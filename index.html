        <p>As my final project for my <em>English and Arts: Milieu</em> course, I made this 3-D render of my visualisation of the poem <em>Beginning Sculpture: The Substractive Method</em>
        by Claudia Emerson. The plain classroom with identical salt blocks represent how all the girls start off with the same block
        and then proceed to shape their sculptures, as if trying to search and create for their own unique identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          This process is allegorical to growing up.
          They all start with a blank slate, and finish with a product they decide and make themselves.
          They start with the general ideas of what they want to be like, then go further in detail as their product becomes polished.
          Due to the nature of the substractive method, the changes done to themselves are permanent.

        <p>
          This also ties to potential of the girls. 
          At the beginning, their potential is at their highest with the blank slates; from here, they can become anything they want.
          However, as they carve their own identity, that potential inevitably decreases.
          Despite this downside, the girls carve away at themselves
