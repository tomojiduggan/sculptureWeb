          As my final project for my English and Arts: Milieu course, 
          I made this 3-D render of my visualization of the poem 
          <em>Beginning Sculpture: The Subtractive Method by Claudia Emerson</em>.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I made this 3D design as my first project in Blender, an open-source software. 
          This design is exported as a .glf file, which is then placed within a Vite project with three.js installed. 
          The mesh is then implemented into a Three.js scene, where a light and auto-rotating camera are added. 
          With a bit of simple HTML, CSS and JS, the description under the form of a sliding page is added. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of the creation of this model, there were only the occasional inconvenience which slowed progress down a bit. 
          The most time-consuming and infuriating part of this project was getting this to work on a website hosted by Vercel. 
          There was so much bug fixing that had to be done within the process of getting this to work within a local environment, and into a hosting service. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I visualized this poem as a simple old-school sculpture classroom with a plank floor and yellow walls. 
          For each identical salt block, I placed a stool as described within the poem: “tall, precarious stools” (2). 
          I decided to place the chisels in the corner of the room as the stools didn’t offer enough space for them. 
          To make it clear that it is a classroom, I added a chalkboard and a desk in the front designated for the teacher. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The plain classroom with identical salt blocks represents how all the girls start off with the same block and then proceed to shape their sculptures, as if trying to search and create their own unique identity. 
          This process is allegorical to growing up. They all start with a blank slate, and finish with a product they decide and make themselves. 
          They start with the general ideas of what they want to be like, then go further in detail as their product becomes polished. 
          Due to the nature of the subtractive method, the changes made in themselves are permanent.
